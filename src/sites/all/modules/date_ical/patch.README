This patch fixes two problems.  It fixes a problem where ical exports were not exporting in UTC. 
The view was generating the time according to the site's timezone setting, but the ical feed
was labeling it as UTC.  This patch fixes the problem by converting the date to UTC.

Also, all day event were not getting generated correctly.
